\title{Map Uniform Samples to Truncated Geometric Categories (Vectorized)}
\usage{
map_to_trunc_geom_vectorized(u, cdf_vals)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{A numeric vector of values between 0 and 1, typically drawn from a uniform distribution.}

\item{cdf_vals}{A numeric vector representing the cumulative probabilities (CDF) of a truncated and normalized geometric distribution.
Must be monotonically increasing and between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the same length as \code{u}, where each element is the corresponding ordinal category (starting at 1).
}
\description{
This function maps uniform random values to ordinal categories based on a truncated geometric cumulative distribution function (CDF).
It is useful for simulating categorical outcomes from a truncated geometric distribution.
}
\details{
Internally uses \code{findInterval()} to map values in \code{u} to bins defined by \code{cdf_vals}.
}
\examples{
cdf_vals <- compute_trunc_geom_cdf(lambda = 0.3, b = 5)
u <- runif(10)
map_to_trunc_geom_vectorized(u, cdf_vals)
