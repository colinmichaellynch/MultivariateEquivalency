\title{Multivariate Equivalency Test Based on Cramér's V}
\usage{
multivariateEquivalency(referenceLimits, data, b, alpha = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{referenceLimits}{A named list where each element is a numeric vector of bin edges for one variable (as produced by \code{binLimits()}).}

\item{data}{A numeric data frame containing the observed values, with columns matching the names in \code{referenceLimits}.}

\item{b}{An integer specifying the number of bins used for each variable.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value for the overall significance level (default is 0.01). Bonferroni correction is applied across \code{p} variables.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{cramersV}}{The observed Cramér's V statistic for each variable.}
\item{\code{cramersVUpper}}{The upper bound for Cramér's V under the null hypothesis, based on the chi-square distribution.}
\item{\code{df}}{Degrees of freedom used in the chi-square test (\code{b - 1}).}
\item{\code{equivalent}}{A character label indicating whether all variables are statistically equivalent to the reference (\code{"Equivalent"} or \code{"Not Equivalent"}).}
}
}
\description{
This function performs an independent multivariate equivalency test between observed data and reference binning limits.
It evaluates whether each feature in a dataset deviates significantly from a uniform reference distribution
using Cramér's V and compares it against a Bonferroni-corrected upper bound derived from the chi-square distribution.
