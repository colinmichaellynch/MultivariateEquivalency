\title{Hotelling's T² Multivariate Control Chart for Process Stability}
\usage{
multivariateProcessStability(data, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix or data frame where rows are observations and columns are variables.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value representing the significance level for the control chart (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
An integer indicating the number of observations that fall outside the control limit (i.e., potential out-of-control points).
}
\description{
This function evaluates the stability of a multivariate process using Hotelling's T² statistic.
It calculates the T² value for each observation, compares it to a control limit derived from the F-distribution,
and plots the results. Out-of-control observations are flagged and optionally displayed in the plot.
}
\details{
The function computes the sample mean vector and covariance matrix, and then calculates the Hotelling's T² statistic for each observation:
\deqn{T^2 = (x_i - \bar{x})^\top S^{-1} (x_i - \bar{x})}
The control limit is calculated using the F-distribution:
\deqn{UCL = \frac{(n - 1)^2}{n} \cdot \frac{p}{n - p} \cdot F_{1 - \alpha}(p, n - p)}
where \eqn{n} is the number of observations and \eqn{p} is the number of variables.

A plot is generated with the T² statistic for each observation and the control limit shown as a red dashed line.
